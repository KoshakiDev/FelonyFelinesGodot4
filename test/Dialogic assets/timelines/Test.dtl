Join Isa 4 [ mirrored="true"]

Isa: Hi there, Musa! What's up?
Join Musa 2
Musa: Isa? 
Isa: First of all, why did you go stealing the secret weapon alone without me?
Musa: Because the GUARDS and CAMERAS will SEE you immediately! 
Isa: But how will they see me though?  
Isa: You and I are as dark as the night!  I can STAY INSIDE THE SHADOW!
Isa: These cameras and guards CANNOT SEE IN THE DARK.
Musa: But cameras and guards CAN SEE IN THE LIGHT, dummy!
Musa: You can't STAY INSIDE A SHADOW even if your life depended on it!
Musa: I can stand face to face to guard IN THE DARK and they will not know I am there! I am pro!
Isa: Ugh, fine. Okay. Anyway, see you later bro!
