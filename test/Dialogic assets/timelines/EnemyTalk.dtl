Isa: Musa! Stop right now!
Join Musa 2
Musa: What is it?
Isa: Do you see that guard?
Musa: What about him?
Isa: You can knock him out with your bat...
Musa: Wooooow! Like I didn't know that.
Isa: ...but could you please not go overboard? Your anger makes your decisions clouded.
Isa: I mean, I get that you are on a mission and all, but PLEASE keep in mind that you DON'T HAVE TO KILL ALL THE GUARDS
Musa: But why not?
Isa: Because these guys will just keep coming! Try to only knock them out when only nesseccary!
Isa: Also, I wanted to share a cool trick you can do.
Isa: If you steal a guards gun, you can distract other guards by shooting bullets. If they see a bullet, they will go after it!
Musa: Okay, will keep that in mind
Isa: Catch ya later!
